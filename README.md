# sonnen_exporter

sonnen_exporter is a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) [Exporter](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/) for batteries from German Manufacturer [Sonnen](https://sonnen.de). It's based on Docker and [prometheus-community/json_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus-community/json_exporter).

It uses API V2 of local battery, docs are available at [your local battery](http://YOURBATTERYIP/api/doc.html).

## Disclaimer

I'm not involved in any way in Sonnen GmbH and this repository is not an official Sonnen GmbH project. This is just a hobby project of some nerd.

Please keep following topics in mind:

* There is no encryption or authentication/authorization included, so I suggest to run this only in a protected environment (like your LAN ... hopefully ðŸ˜‰) and don't publish this service to the Internet. If your Prometheus is not running in the same environment as this project, please use some kind of tunnel technology like VPN.
* docker-compose.yml is referencing to the latest json_exporter available in Docker Registry. In a commercial environment, this is often seen as an anti pattern because it could lead to unintended updates and broken systems. However, in my specific scenario, I want to refer to the latest available image. If something fails unintended, I need to fix it.

## How to use

Requirements:

* Have a server with Docker installed
* Have a Sonnen battery which supports API V2 and have Sonnen battery prepared (see below)

### Prepare Sonnen battery

You need an Auth token which can be found at [your local battery Web UI](http://YOURBATTERYIP/dash/software-integration/json-api). Please make sure to enable "Read API" at same page before accessing API. I also suggest to disable "Write API" and test your config using curl.

## Setup

To setup sonnen_exporter using Ansible please ensure to have at least Ansible 2.7 installed at your system. If that's the case, run following commands:

```
cd /YOUR/REPO/CHECKOUT/PATH/sonnen_exporter.git/ansible
cp roles/install-sonnen_exporter/vars/main-sample.yml roles/install-sonnen_exporter/vars/main.yml
```

Open `roles/install-sonnen_exporter/vars/main.yml` in your prefered editor and insert your personal Auth token.

To run this role and install sonnen_exporter at your server, you can use following command:

```
cd /YOUR/REPO/CHECKOUT/PATH/sonnen_exporter.git/ansible
ansible -i /PATH/TO/INVENTORY -b YOURSERVERNAME -m ansible.builtin.include_role --args name=install-sonnen_exporter
```

## Start

After setup, sonnen_exporter can be started using

```
docker compose up
```

or 

```
docker compose up -d
```

in setup directory.

This will start a web service at port 7979. Following APIs can be scraped by Prometheus:

| Description | URL |
| --- | --- |
| Overall status of entire system | http://YOURSONNENEXPORTERIP:7979/probe?module=sonnen_v2_status&target=http://YOURSONNENBATTERYIP/api/v2/status |
| Battery specific data | http://YOURSONNENEXPORTERIP:7979/probe?module=sonnen_v2_battery&target=http://YOURSONNENBATTERYIP/api/v2/battery |
| Inverter specific data | http://YOURSONNENEXPORTERIP:7979/probe?module=sonnen_v2_inverter&target=http://YOURSONNENBATTERYIP/api/v2/inverter |
| Configuration data | http://YOURSONNENEXPORTERIP:7979/probe?module=sonnen_v2_configurations&target=http://YOURSONNENBATTERYIP/api/v2/configurations |

## Upgrade

Ansible role is creating a cronjob which updates base image every night.
